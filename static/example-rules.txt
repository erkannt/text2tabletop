AP: Targets get -X to Defense rolls when blocking hits.

Deadly: Assign each wound to one model, and multiply it by X. Note that these wounds don't carry over to other models if the target is killed.

Defense: [Skirmify] Gets +X to Defense rolls.

Fearless: Gets +1 to morale tests.

Furious: Gets +1 attack with a weapon of your choice when charging.

Hero: Friendly units within 12” of the hero may use his quality for morale tests, as long as it isn’t Stunned.

Poison: Unmodified results of 6 to hit are multiplied by 3.

Rending: Unmodified results of 6 to hit count as having AP(4), and ignore the regeneration rule.

Scout: This model may be deployed after all other units, and may then move by up to 12”, ignoring terrain. If both of the players have Scout, they roll-off to see who deploys first, and then alternate in placing and moving them.

Stealth: Enemies get -1 to hit rolls when shooting at this unit.

Strider: This model may ignore the effects of difficult terrain. This model only needs to roll 2+ for a successful drop, leap or jump.

Tough: This model only rolls to see what happens from wounds once it has taken at least X wounds, and is only Knocked Out on rolls of 5+X or more. When Stunned and hit by shooting or charged, this model takes 1 wound instead of being Knocked Out, unless it already has X or more wounds.

Wizard: May cast one spell during its activation, at any point before attacking. Pick a spell and a target in line of sight and roll D6+X. If the result is equal or higher than the number in brackets, you may resolve the effects. Spells may target a single unit or split their effects evenly among all friendly or enemy units within 6” of a single model (target picks how). Enemy wizards within 18” and line of sight of the caster may roll D6+X at the same time, and if their result is higher the spell is blocked. Wizards may only either try to cast or try to block a spell each round.
